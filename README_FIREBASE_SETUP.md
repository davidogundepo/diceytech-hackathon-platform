# Firebase Backend Setup Complete

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. Firebase Configuration (`src/config/firebase.ts`)
- Initialized Firebase with your environment variables
- Configured Authentication, Firestore, and Storage services
- Ready to use across the application

### 2. TypeScript Type Definitions (`src/types/firestore.ts`)
- **User** - Complete user profiles with skills, bio, location, social links
- **Project** - Project portfolios with tech stack, images, collaboration details
- **Hackathon** - Hackathon events with prizes, dates, participants
- **Application** - Job/hackathon applications with status tracking
- **Notification** - Real-time notifications system
- **Achievement** - Gamification achievements
- **UserAchievement** - User-earned achievements with progress tracking

### 3. Authentication Service (`src/services/authService.ts`)
- ✅ Email/Password authentication
- ✅ Google Sign-In
- ✅ Session persistence
- ✅ Auto-profile creation on signup
- ✅ Profile completion tracking

### 4. Firestore Service (`src/services/firestoreService.ts`)
Complete CRUD operations for all collections:
- **Users**: Create, read, update profiles
- **Projects**: Full project management
- **Hackathons**: Hackathon creation and management
- **Applications**: Application tracking
- **Notifications**: Real-time notification system
- **Achievements**: Achievement system
- ✅ Real-time listeners for live updates
- ✅ Search functionality across collections
- ✅ Pagination support

### 5. Storage Service (`src/services/storageService.ts`)
- Upload/delete user avatars
- Upload/delete project images
- Upload/delete hackathon images
- Automatic file organization by type

### 6. Achievement Service (`src/services/achievementService.ts`)
Automatic achievement triggers:
- First Project completion
- Hackathon participation milestones
- Job application milestones
- Profile completion
- Social engagement (likes, collaborations)

### 7. Custom React Hooks (`src/hooks/useFirestore.ts`)
Easy-to-use hooks for:
- `useFirestoreDoc` - Single document with real-time updates
- `useFirestoreCollection` - Collection queries with filters
- `useFirestore` - General-purpose Firestore hook

### 8. Updated AuthContext (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)
- Replaced mock authentication with real Firebase
- Google Sign-In integration
- Loading states
- Error handling with toasts

### 9. Security Rules
- **Firestore Rules** (`firestore.rules`) - Row-level security with role-based access
- **Storage Rules** (`storage.rules`) - Secure file uploads with size/type validation

## 🔒 Security Implementation

### Role-Based Access Control
- **Admin Role**: Full access to all resources
- **User Role**: Access to own resources
- **User Roles Collection**: Separate table for secure role management

### Firestore Security
- Users can only edit their own profiles
- Projects are publicly readable, editable by owner/admin
- Notifications are private to each user
- Applications visible only to applicant and employer

### Storage Security
- Public read access for profile/project images
- Write access only for authenticated owners
- File size limit: 5MB
- Image type validation

## 📊 Data Structure

### Users Collection
```
users/{userId}
├── displayName: string
├── email: string
├── photoURL: string
├── bio: string
├── skills: string[]
├── location: string
├── phone: string
└── social links...
```

### Projects Collection
```
projects/{projectId}
├── userId: string
├── title: string
├── description: string
├── techStack: string[]
├── images: string[]
├── githubUrl: string
└── likes, views, status...
```

### Hackathons Collection
```
hackathons/{hackathonId}
├── title: string
├── organizerId: string
├── description: string
├── prize: string
├── startDate: Timestamp
├── endDate: Timestamp
└── participants, status...
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### To Complete Full Integration:

1. **Deploy Security Rules**:
   ```bash
   # In Firebase Console:
   # 1. Go to Firestore Database > Rules
   # 2. Copy content from firestore.rules
   # 3. Go to Storage > Rules  
   # 4. Copy content from storage.rules
   ```

2. **Initialize Admin User** (Optional):
   ```javascript
   // Create admin user in Firestore Console:
   Collection: user_roles
   Document ID: {your-user-id}
   Fields: { role: "admin" }
   ```

3. **Seed Initial Data** (Optional):
   - Create some sample hackathons
   - Create achievement templates
   - Add initial notifications

4. **Update Pages** (In Progress):
   - Connect Dashboard to real Firebase data
   - Connect Profile page to Firestore
   - Connect ExploreProjects to Firestore
   - Add real-time notifications
   - Implement search functionality

5. **Testing**:
   - Test email/password signup
   - Test Google Sign-In
   - Test file uploads
   - Test real-time updates
   - Test achievement system

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Creating a New Project
```typescript
import { firestoreService } from '@/services/firestoreService';

const createProject = async () => {
  const projectData = {
    title: "My Awesome Project",
    description: "A cool project",
    techStack: ["React", "Firebase"],
    // ... other fields
  };
  
  const projectId = await firestoreService.createProject(projectData);
};
```

### Real-time Notifications
```typescript
import { firestoreService } from '@/services/firestoreService';

// Listen to new notifications
const unsubscribe = firestoreService.listenToUserNotifications(
  userId,
  (notifications) => {
    console.log('New notifications:', notifications);
  }
);

// Don't forget to unsubscribe
return () => unsubscribe();
```

### Uploading Files
```typescript
import { storageService } from '@/services/storageService';

const uploadAvatar = async (file: File) => {
  const url = await storageService.uploadUserAvatar(userId, file);
  console.log('Avatar URL:', url);
};
```

## 🎯 Features Ready to Use

## 📝 Notes

- All Firebase services are initialized and ready
- Security rules need to be deployed manually via Firebase Console
- Achievement system will automatically track user progress
- Real-time listeners are optimized to prevent memory leaks
- Error handling is implemented throughout with toast notifications
- Loading states are managed in custom hooks
