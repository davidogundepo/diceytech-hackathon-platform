Hi Team,

I'm excited to announce that the **DiceyTech Hackathon Platform** is now ready for rigorous testing! 🎉

After weeks of development, we've built a comprehensive platform that handles everything from user registration to admin management. I need your expertise to put it through its paces.

## 🌐 Platform Overview

The DiceyTech platform is a full-featured hackathon management system built on **Firebase/Firestore**, a production-grade cloud infrastructure that powers applications serving **millions of users globally**. While it's not AWS (I know that's our usual go-to), Firebase is specifically designed for scalability and can comfortably handle:

✅ **Tens of thousands of concurrent users**  
✅ **Hundreds of thousands of applications**  
✅ **Real-time data synchronization**  
✅ **Auto-scaling with zero configuration**  
✅ **99.95% uptime SLA**

Firebase powers apps like Duolingo, The New York Times, and Alibaba - so we're in good company for handling scale.

## 🧪 Your Mission: Test & Destroy!

I need you to **stress-test this platform** and find every bug, edge case, and UX issue you can. Here's what to do:

### 1. **Create a User Account**
- Visit the platform: [Insert Your Platform URL]
- Sign up as a regular user
- Explore the hackathon listings
- Submit a test application
- Check your profile, notifications, and saved events

### 2. **Access Admin Panel**
- Navigate to: `/admin/login`
- **Test Admin Credentials:**
  - **Email:** `david@redtechafrica.com`
  - **Password:** `qwertty`

### 3. **Admin Features to Test**
Once logged in as admin, please test:
- ✅ **Dashboard** - View platform statistics
- ✅ **Hackathon Management** - Create, edit, delete hackathons
- ✅ **User Management** - View users, promote to admin, manage accounts
- ✅ **Application Management** - Review and approve/reject applications
- ✅ **Project Management** - Feature projects, moderate submissions
- ✅ **Notification Center** - Broadcast messages to all users
- ✅ **Analytics** - View charts and platform metrics

### 4. **Things to Specifically Break**
- Try submitting malformed data
- Test mobile responsiveness (works in dark/light mode)

## 💡 Why This Matters

This platform will be the backbone of our hackathon operations. It needs to be bulletproof before we open it to real applicants. Your testing is **critical** to ensuring we deliver a professional, reliable experience.

I'm confident in the infrastructure's ability to scale, but I need your eyes to catch the edge cases and user experience issues that only real-world testing can reveal.
