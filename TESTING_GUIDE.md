# DiceyTech Testing Guide

## üöÄ Getting Started

This guide provides **EXACT** steps to test every Firebase-integrated feature of the DiceyTech platform.

---

## üìã Prerequisites

Before testing, ensure:
1. Firebase project is set up and environment variables are configured in `.env`
2. Firestore database is created
3. Firebase Authentication is enabled (Email/Password and Google providers)
4. Firebase Storage is enabled

---

## üå± Step 0: Seed the Database

**This is REQUIRED before testing!** The database needs sample data.

1. Open your browser console (F12)
2. Navigate to the app homepage: `http://localhost:5173`
3. In the console, run:
```javascript
import { seedDatabase } from './src/utils/seedData';
await seedDatabase();
```

**OR** create a temporary button in your app to trigger seeding:
```tsx
import { seedDatabase } from '@/utils/seedData';

<Button onClick={async () => {
  await seedDatabase();
  toast({ title: "Database seeded!" });
}}>
  Seed Database
</Button>
```

**Expected Result:**
- Console will show progress: "Creating sample users...", "Creating sample projects...", etc.
- Final message: "Database seeding completed successfully!"
- You'll see a summary of created items

**Verify in Firebase Console:**
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to Firestore Database
4. You should see collections: `users`, `projects`, `hackathons`, `achievements`, `applications`, `notifications`, `userAchievements`

---

## üîê Test 1: Sign Up with Email/Password

**Exact Steps:**
1. Navigate to the login page: `http://localhost:5173`

   - Email: `test@diceytech.com`
   - Password: `Test123!@#`
   - Confirm Password: `Test123!@#`
4. Click **"Create Account"** button

**What Should Happen:**
- Button shows "Creating account..." loading state
- Toast notification: "Account created! Welcome to DiceyTech!"
- You are automatically redirected to `/dashboard`
- Top navigation shows your profile with display name "Test User"

**Verify in Firebase Console:**
1. Go to Authentication tab
2. You should see a new user with email `test@diceytech.com`
3. Go to Firestore Database ‚Üí `users` collection
4. Find document with the same UID as the authenticated user
5. Document should contain: `email`, `displayName`, `role`, `skills`, `profileCompleteness`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`

**Possible Issues:**
- ‚ùå Error: "Email already in use" ‚Üí Email exists, use a different one

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Missing or insufficient permissions"
**Solution:** Check Firestore Security Rules. For development, you can use:
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

### Issue: "Storage: User does not have permission"
**Solution:** Check Storage Rules:
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /avatars/{userId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    match /project-images/{allPaths=**} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

### Issue: Projects not showing
**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Firestore connection in DevTools Network tab
3. Check if `getAllProjects()` is being called
4. Verify projects exist in Firestore Console

### Issue: Google Sign-In fails
**Solution:**
1. In Firebase Console ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Sign-in method
2. Enable Google provider
3. Add authorized domains: `localhost`, your production domain
4. Check browser allows popups

### Issue: Real-time updates not working
**Solution:**
1. Check Firestore subscriptions are set up (`.onSnapshot()`)
2. Verify cleanup functions run on unmount
3. Check browser console for subscription errors
